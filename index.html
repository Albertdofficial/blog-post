  <h1>THE INTERNET AND SOLUTION TO AFRICA’S POOR CONNECTIVITY.</h1>

    <h2>What is the internet?</h2>

    <p>
      The internet is the infrastructure that carries things like: email, the web, file sharing, online education, streaming services etc. In simple terms, the internet is a bunch of connected devices.
    </p>

  </div>

    <h2 class="section2-h2">How does the internet work?</h2>
    <div class="section-two">
    <p class="flex-item">
      For instance, say I have my friend in Freetown whom I want to talk with; one way that could be done is by connecting a crossover cable from my computer to his or her computer. A crossover cable is an Ethernet cable that allows you to connect
      two like devices together. But this is not the best solution especially if there are more friends whose devices I want to connect with.
    </p>

    <p  class="flex-item">
      Thankfully, the internet uses something called routing, where there are physical devices and there are other machines who have the job of connecting my information or my data to somebody else. So the way that devices are been identified is
      through IP address short for Internet Protocol. So the only thing that my computer needs to know about my friend’s device or the billions of other machines out there are these IP addresses.
    </p>


    <p  class="flex-item">
      In more advance terms, the internet is a network of networks, say perhaps, I need an internet in my house, I would first need to contact a local internet company in my country who are connected to the Global Internet, then they will connect me to
      their network in order for me to access the Global network. So what the company will do is to simply bring a router in my home. The router is responsible for routing IP addresses. The router is needed in order to get a network traffic from one
      IP network to a different IP network. And finally my devices can now connect to the internet via my router and communicate with any device on the internet.
    </p> 
  </div>

  <div class="section-three">
    <h2> How is the data sent?</h2>
    <p>
      Simply my data makes it way over cables. From my house I can tell you that I have got a Wifi Network, but that Wi-Fi is powered by an AT & T cable coming to my house. It is buried underground, it goes along my road and then at some points that
      meet up with some other cables and they are joined together. And there are a whole bunch of undersea cables that go all over the globe. My data makes its way though those cables as pulses of light, that is, electrons going through the cable.
      It’s
      really kind of miraculous how it all works.
    </p>

  <h2 class="last-h2">How can Africa improve Internet Connectivity?</h2>
  <div class="section-four">
    
    <p  class="flex-item2">
      According to the Internation Finance Cooperation <span> <a href="https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/news_ext_content/ifc_external_corporate_site/news+and+events/news/cm-stories/cm-connecting-africa" target="_blank">ifc.org</a></span>, World Bank Group; “today, more than 1.2 million kilometers of internet cables run accross the ocean’s floor, but just 20 years ago Africa was completely disconnected.
      Africa has the lowest number of Internet connections—only 22 percent of the continent has access. It also has the largest potential for progress."
      They also projected that the next step of broadband expansion in Africa is fibre-optic network. 
      One kilometer of fibre-optic cable cost $30, 000 and according them Africa needs 500, 000 km to achieve full connectivity-that is $15 billion.
    </p>
    <p  class="flex-item2">
      Looking from another spectrum, I see satellite internet services to be the way for Africa in order to solve its connectivity issues. According to a description on <span> <a href="https://www.starlink.com/" target="_blank">Starlink</a></span> , 
      Starlink is a satellite internet constellation being
      constructed by SpaceX providing satellite Internet access., it reads: “Sarlink is ideally suited for areas of the globe where connectivity has typically been a challenge. Unbound by traditional ground infrastructure, Starlink can deliver
      hight-speed broadband internet to locations where access has been unreliable or completely unavailable”.
    </p>

    <p  class="flex-item2">
      Satellite internet service provides the best solution to Africa’s poor internet connectivity. Starlink in particular because it promises availabillty, reliability and a relatively cheaper cost for connecting Africa to the Internet as there would
      be no extra cost on buying fibre optic cables!
